## Hackathon MVP (5 hours)
- Capture at least 4 screenshots and 3 clips from the list.
- Prioritize patch recompute and trace screen proof clips.

## Post-hack Hardening (2-4 weeks)
- Replace screenshots with polished UI captures.
- Add side-by-side comparison clips for before/after patch behavior.
